In web development, containers are used to group and structure content within a webpage, providing a flexible layout for elements like text, images, or forms
 A container typically uses a fixed or responsive width to center or align content, while container-fluid expands to take up the full width of the viewport, allowing the design to adjust dynamically to different screen sizes. These layout techniques are crucial for creating responsive web pages that look great on both large and small screens.

Values of a webpage refer to its visual and functional elements, such as layout, typography, color schemes, and overall usability. Proper use of containers and fluid containers enhances the webpage's responsiveness, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices.
